                            This group project involved building a web-based interactive quiz application named "Santar: Naughty or Nice." The primary goal was to create an engaging and dynamic quiz using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition to leading and managing the project, I was responsible for designing the application's structure, visual themes, transitions, and interactive animations. I worked closely with my team to ensure the user experience was seamless, fun, and visually appealing.<br><br>
                            <strong>What I learned:</strong> Through this project, I further deepened my knowledge of JavaScript and its various frameworks and libraries, including jQuery and Lottie, as well as working with JSON. These tools allowed me to add dynamic animations and interactive features to the application. I dedicated over 100 hours to the development process, including spending 15 hours each single day during the Holy Week to refine the application. This experience not only helped me enhance my technical skills but also taught me important life lessons in patience, perseverance, and collaboration.

                            This was one of the most enjoyable and fulfilling projects during the midterm. The group created an Italian-themed restaurant website named “Bistrovanti.” I led the project's design direction, carefully selecting the color scheme, layout, and typography to match the branding. I developed the initial website template, which included the navigation structure and reusable components. Then, I connected everyone’s contributions and integrated them into a cohesive site. We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to bring the concept to life, ensuring it was both aesthetically pleasing and fully responsive.<br><br>
                            <strong>What I learned:</strong> This project significantly enhanced my CSS skills, especially when creating responsive layouts using media queries. I practiced manipulating the interface manually — without AI help — and developed a deeper intuition for frontend styling. It gave me hands-on experience building and maintaining modular code, as well as ensuring cross-device compatibility.

                            This project involved designing a conference/event webpage that could effectively present key information such as the event schedule, featured speakers, and venue details. While brainstorming ideas, I happened to be listening to AESPA, a K-pop girl group, and was immediately inspired by their Whiplash album's futuristic concept photos. I decided to go with a bold, neon-infused aesthetic that matched the high-tech, high-energy theme. The page layout was carefully structured to guide users through the event's highlights while keeping the design immersive and visually engaging.<br><br>
                            <strong>What I learned:</strong> This task helped me sharpen my skills in content organization — especially in crafting pages that require structured, multi-part content like schedules and lineups. I also focused on improving the clarity and flow of information while making sure the site remained easy to navigate. The balance of creative visual style and user-friendly layout was a key takeaway for me.

                            This activity was conducted during one of our on-site classes and focused on practicing JavaScript operators. I developed a basic webpage that demonstrates how arithmetic and other operators function within different expressions. The primary objective was to combine these operators in custom functions that performed simple computations. While this was admittedly the least exciting activity for me, I still put effort into creating a clean, functional demonstration of core JavaScript logic.<br><br>

Though not the most creative task, it was fundamental in strengthening my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals.
